N-th Roots of Unity Visualization

An interactive visualization of modular multiplication patterns on the unit circle, revealing beautiful mathematical structures.

Features:
- Dynamic visualization of complex roots of unity
- Real-time parameter adjustments
- Multiple color modes (rainbow, gradient, connection-based)
- Mathematical formula display with KaTeX rendering
- Export high-quality PNG images
- Animation system for pattern exploration

Mathematical Foundation:
Visualizes the mapping:
z_k = e^(2œÄik/n) = cos(2œÄk/n) + i¬∑sin(2œÄk/n)
k ‚Üí (k √ó multiplier) mod n

Where:
- n = number of points (roots)
- multiplier = connection pattern generator

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/khabzox/times-table-visualizer.git
cd unity-roots-visualization

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Run the development server:
npm run dev

Usage:
Controls:
Parameter        Range       Description
