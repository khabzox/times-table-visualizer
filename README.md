# N-th Roots of Unity Visualization

An interactive mathematical visualization that plots the n-th roots of unity on the complex plane and dynamically connects them using modular multiplication to reveal beautiful geometric patterns.

## üî¨ Mathematical Foundation

### Core Concept
The n-th roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation z^n = 1. They can be expressed using Euler's formula:

```
z_k = e^(2œÄik/n) = cos(2œÄk/n) + i¬∑sin(2œÄk/n)
```

Where:
- `k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1` (indices of the roots)
- `n` is the total number of roots
- Each `z_k` represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane

### Pattern Generation
The visual patterns are created by connecting each root `z_k` to `z_{(k √ó multiplier) % n}`, where:
- `multiplier` is a dynamic parameter that determines the connection pattern
- The modulo operation ensures we stay within the valid range of roots
- Different multipliers create different geometric patterns (cardioids, roses, etc.)

## üé® Visual Features

### Interactive Controls
- **n (Number of Roots)**: Controls how many points are placed around the unit circle
- **Multiplier**: Determines the connection pattern between points
- **Animation**: Automatically evolves the multiplier to show pattern transitions
- **Display Options**: Toggle between polar and Cartesian coordinate labels

### Pattern Examples
- `multiplier = 2`: Creates a cardioid (heart-shaped curve)
- `multiplier = 3`: Forms a nephroid (kidney-shaped curve)
- `multiplier = 4`: Generates a three-cusped epicycloid
- Prime multipliers often create the most interesting patterns

## üìä Pattern Gallery

### Famous Curves Generated
- **Cardioid** (n=200, multiplier=2): Heart-shaped curve from circle rolling around another circle
- **Nephroid** (n=200, multiplier=3): Two-cusped curve, envelope of circles
- **Deltoid** (n=200, multiplier=4): Three-cusped hypocycloid

### Interesting Observations
- When `gcd(multiplier, n) = 1`, the pattern connects all points
- Prime multipliers often create the most symmetric patterns
- Large values of n create smoother, more continuous curves
- Certain multiplier ratios create self-similar fractal-like structures
